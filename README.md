What is RBD(Randomized Block Design)?
Lets take a example,  If a farm has a field of corn affected by a plant disease and wants to test the efficacy of different fungicides in controlling it, they may split the field into blocks and randomly treat section of each block with the various fungicides to be tested. This is an example of a block design experiment. Moreover Crops need nitrogen in soil to be fertile but, How much amount of nitrogen is sufficient and significant for a crop ? This can be checked by the RBD design. 

What solution we have added to this theory?
We have created a C++ code which takes the experimental variables and treatments value and directly calculates the necessary data and shows the experiment values used are significant or not like , nitrogen level in soil, best fungicide efficacy on plant disease etc.
